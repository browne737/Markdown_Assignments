# ls
The `ls` command can be used to show the _list_  of all files or folders in a directory. For example:

```
ls Documents
```

Here's some more information about the `ls` command:

- It can be used to look at the _previous_ directories with the `../` command. For example: `ls ../../`, which would show you the items in the directory that is two away from your current directory.
- You can see all hidden files in your current directory with the `-a` command, the a would represent _all_: `ls -a`
